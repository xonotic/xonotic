/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4) 
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a sky box (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the sky box surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects. As it is compiler-only, it can't "scale up" entities in its box.
To use this, carve a small box in some larger structure on your map, place this entity inside that box hole, and make a small version on what should be seen in the sky there.
-------- KEYS --------
angle: rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
angles: Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
_scale: scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.

Normal sliding door entity. By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.
If DOOR_DONT_LINK is not set, the door will be linked with all doors it touches. Note however that for linked doors to work properly, it is necessary that ALL linked doors have SOME volume of common area (that is, there must be a point that is part of ALL doors).

BIDIR makes the door work bidirectional, so that the opening direction is always away from the requestor.
The usage of bidirectional doors requires two manually instantiated triggers (trigger_multiple), the one to open it in the other direction
must have set trigger_reverse to 1.
BIDIR_IN_DOWN will the door prevent from reopening while closing if it is triggered from the other side.

_lightmapscale: light map resolution factor
_castshadows: Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_receiveshadows: Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ? - - CRUSH
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off.
-------- KEYS --------
speed: determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip: lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height: if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg: damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat. Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname: if set, the trigger that points to this will lower the plat each time it fires. The plat lowers and lifts someone up later.
sounds: 2 for alternate sound set, -1 for silence, or use the fields below
sound1: platform starts moving sound
sound2: platform stop sound
message: kill message, when someone gets killed by this plat
message2: death message when someone gets pushed into this (default: "was thrown into a world of hurt by"). The # character is replaced by the attacker name if present (and it instead does not get appended to the end)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
CRUSH: crush players hit by the platform instantly
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Non-displayed point light source. The -pointscale and -scale arguments to Q3Map2 affect the brightness of these lights. The -skyscale argument affects brightness of entity sun lights.
Maximum intensity (in a radius 16 sphere around the light): regular lights have light/256, linear lights have light/8000-16*fade.
Falloff radius to a negligible light amount: regular lights have light have 16*sqrt(light), linear lights have light/(fade*8000).

Laser beam emitter. Note that for the laser to be deadly, it has to start OUTSIDE the player's collision box. To ensure this, you may want to put this entity inside the walls (or directly on their surface), or cover it with a playerclip brush.
-------- KEYS --------
target: target_position the laser targets (may be another entity, preferably target_position, possibly controlled by misc_follow)

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_ON: when targeted, the laser will start switched on
FINITE: the laser does not extend over its target like light would do, but stops there (takes more bandwidth)

-------- KEYS --------
model: when used as a point entity, file name of model to load; when used as a brush entity, do not specify that
frame: animation frame to play (for self-animated zym models)

targetname: when invoking it by a button etc., it changes the color to the initiator of the action (e.g. the one pressing a button). In Onslaught, this can be used to color control points for team who owns them. In other game types, this can be used as a fun feature.
originjitter: a vector describing a random offset this entity will be moved on initial spawn. This corresponds to the "origin" field. Works on any non-q3map2-only entity.
anglesjitter: a vector in the order "pitch yaw roll" describing a random angles change on this entity on initial spawn. The value 180 180 180 makes the angles entirely random and uniformly distributed (among euler angles). This corresponds to the "angles" field. Works on any non-q3map2-only entity.
anglejitter: a float describing a random yaw angle change on this entity on initial spawn. The value 180 makes the yaw angle entirely random (maybe good for items). This corresponds to the "angle" field. Works on any non-q3map2-only entity.
gametypefilter: either a + sign and a comma separated list of game types or the aliases "teams" and "noteams" to ONLY show the entity in the listed game types, or a - sign and a comma separated list of game types or the aliases "teams" and "noteams" to NOT show the entity in the listed game types. The syntax is the same as in sbar_columns_set strings. Works on any non-q3map2-only entity.
cvarfilter: either a + sign and a space separated list of conditions, or a - sign and the same for an inverted filter. The conditions are ALWAYS combined with AND! Possible conditions are: "cvar==value", "cvar!=value", "cvar<value", "cvar>value", "cvar<=value", "cvar>=value", "cvar===string", "cvar!==string", "cvar", "!cvar". Ridiculous example filter: "-g_balance_health_start<150 g_balance_armor_start==0" spawns an item only if start health is at least 150 or start armor is not 0. Other ideas: "+g_campaign" and "-g_campaign" for enabling/disabling items when the map is played as part of the campaign.

-------- KEYS --------
cnt: Number of the checkpoint. 0 for start/finish line, and at least two other checkpoints have to exist. They MUST be touched in sequential order!
message: Death message, when touching checkpoints in the wrong order.
message2: Death message when someone gets pushed into this (default: "was thrown into a world of hurt by"). The # character is replaced by the attacker name if present (and it instead does not get appended to the end)
targetname: Name of the checkpoint. info_player_race can target this to assign a spawn to a checkpoint. Also used for triggering a checkpoint by an event.
target: when the checkpoint is passed, these entities are triggered. Useful for forcing items in certain areas using trigger_items
race_penalty: when set, this penalty time is given if passing this checkpoint, and the checkpoint does not show up with a sprite. Useful for invisible checkpoints to detect driving around the intended checkpoint
race_penalty_reason: reason to display when the penalty time is imposed. Default: "missing a checkpoint"

/*QUAKED info_player_race (1 0.5 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 45) 
Race spawn point.
NOTE for race_place: when the race starts after the qualifying, the player with the fastest lap ends up at the info_player_race with race_place 1, and so on. If there are too many players, or if someone comes in later, he will spawn at an info_player_race with highest race_place. If someone dies after reaching the the starting checkpoint, he will spawn at race_place 0. So for each trigger_race_checkpoint, there must be at least one corresponding info_player_race with race_place NOT set.
-------- KEYS --------
target: this should point to a trigger_race_checkpoint to decide when this spawning point is active. The checkpoint has to be AFTER this spawn.
target2: trigger all entities with this targetname when someone spawns
cnt: weight of spawn point for random selection. Set to a lower value if you have many spawn points close together. Default value is 1.
race_place: if target points to the trigger_race_checkpoint with cnt 0 (finish line), this sets which place the spawn corresponds to; the special value 0 stands for spawns for players who died in game, and -1 marks the spawnpoint for qualifying mode only; any race map must have spawnpoints with race_place being 1, 2, 3 or it gets marked as a frustrating map

IMPULSE: only send the full amount of impulse particles when the entity is triggered
-------- NOTES --------
Use trigger_monoflop if you want the particles to turn off for a while, then turn back on.
A BGM script is a .bgs file named like the map, in the maps directory. Its format is lines of the form
  <emitter class> <time since start of background music> <0 if the emitters are to be switched off, >0 and <=1 if they are to be switched on>
e.g.
  smokers 4.7 1
  smokers 4.9 0
The lines MUST be sorted by emitter class as primary key, and by the time since start of the BGM as secondary key.

The special "field" name $ calls a void(void) function, for example a spawn function.
Special function names available are _setmodel and _setsize.
Field values can use various variable replacements:
$E
$E.field
$E.field+offset
$E.field+offset+randomoffset
where "E" can be self, activator, target (the entity being created/modified), killtarget, target2, target3, target4 and pusher.
