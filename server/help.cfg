// Simple help message system
// It prints messages with the configured name and interval to all connected users
// Exec this file and start the help system with the command help_loop
// You can adjust those two settings and change the messages and their count
// help_cfg_time is the time between two messages in seconds
// help_cfg_prefix is prepended to each message, useful to color the nick and message differently
// help_msg_count is from 0 to last message, thus one more then the last message number you want
// the messages need to be starting from 0 and be consecutive
// for manual use: help_inc switches to the next message, help_doit will print the current message, help_next will do both together
