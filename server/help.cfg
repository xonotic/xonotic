// Simple help message system
// It prints messages with the configured name and interval to all connected users
// Exec this file and start the help system with the command help_loop
// You can adjust those two settings and change the messages and their count
// help_cfg_time is the time between two messages in seconds
// help_cfg_prefix is prepended to each message, useful to color the nick and message differently
// help_msg_count is from 0 to last message, thus one more then the last message number you want
// the messages need to be starting from 0 and be consecutive
// for manual use: help_inc switches to the next message, help_doit will print the current message, help_next will do both together

set help_msg_5 "Spectating other (good) players helps to learn new tricks. To spectate press F3 and then Mouse1 to switch between the players you want to spectate. F5, F6 or jump will get you back into the game (default keys)."
set help_msg_6 "Being a beginner is great! You can learn so many new tricks and improve quickly. Watch others, ask for advice and use your common sense effectively."
set help_msg_7 "If others are better than you, it does not mean they cheat. Save such complaints for when you have more experience and know what kind of funky stuff is possible."
set help_msg_8 "In CTF, it's good to move around and get involved in the action. You get fragged quite a bit but you are also most helpful to your team."
set help_msg_9 "Use the radar to see where your teammates are. Pressing zoom will expand the radar image to give you a better overview."
set help_msg_10 "Most teammessages display waypoints by default. Use those to guide your teammates. You can also see them and the flagcarrier in the radar."
set help_msg_11 "Protect your flagcarrier at all cost! Also save health and armor for him, he might need them more than you!"
set help_msg_12 "You can use the Blaster and most explosive weapons to jump around. Just look 'at your feet' and press fire. If you also jump at the same time you get even higher."
set help_msg_13 "Be friendly and helpful to other players! Being angry at others' mistakes is understandable, but nobody is perfect. Try to use calm words when telling them how to correct their mistake."
set help_msg_14 "You can use the zoom key with all guns, only the Vortex has it as a extra function on Mouse2 (default key)."
set help_msg_15 "Notice what is happening around you! If your base is empty in CTF then STAY and defend the flag! Make sure someone defends the flagcarrier or assist him yourself."

set help_msg_26 "The Machine Gun secondary has a burst fire mode and less spread than the primary mode."
set help_msg_27 "The Mortar is a good all around gun but takes some practice to aim it, because of the projectile's curve."
set help_msg_28 "The Electro has a combo attack. Fire the primary mode at the balls from the secondary mode for a huge and powerful explosion."
set help_msg_29 "The Crylink's primary fire bounces. Both firemodes pull your enemies, making it a great tool to stop a flag carrier."

set help_msg_33 "The Arc is a strong lighting beam, which bends slighty if you move your mouse. The secondary firemode is very strong but short. Both firemodes also heal teammates if you shoot at them."
