/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Everything has some sensible defaults so you do NOT really need to
// change anything.  But here are some settings you SHOULD change to
// make it 'YOUR' server.  IF so remove the // from the line start and
// change them to your liking.

//sv_public 1	// 0 if the server should not be on the public servers list
//sv_status_privacy 1	// 1 hides IP addresses from "status" replies shown to clients, 0 shows them. Enables players to identify wellknown punks on your server OR is a thread to anonymity.. depending on your point of view :)
//hostname "Xonotic $g_xonoticversion Server"	// this name will appear on the server list (the $g_xonoticversion gets replaced with the current version)
//sv_motd ""	// this message (unless "") is displayed to players on connect
//maxplayers 8	// number of players allowed on the server
//port 26000	// the port used by the server
//log_file "server.log"	// server console output will also be copied to this file. This: "${serverconfig}.log" uses variable substitution to make the logfile have the same name as your config file with .log appended which is useful if you run several servers
//g_start_delay 15	// delay before the game starts to let players join the server first

// List of maps to play on the server.  Set to "" to autodetect (which would enumerate ALL maps.  Maps that don't support the current game mode will be skipped, so you don't need to remove them here.
//g_maplist "afterslime dance g-23 glowplant leave_em_behind newtonian-nightmare nexballarena red-planet runningman space-elevator stormkeep techassault xoylent"
//g_maplist_shuffle 1	// 0 always selects the next map out of g_maplist (but then better set g_maplist_votable 0 below to prevent repetitive votes), 1 will select random maps each time
//g_maplist_mostrecent_count 3	// number of maps that have to be played before a map can be repeated

// LIMITS: how long a match will last before the next map starts (-1 means use the map default, 0 = unlimited, please note that the variables fraglimit/timelimit can NOT be globally used for this but only DURING a match is being played)
//timelimit_override -1	// global timelimit for all maps and gametypes
//fraglimit_override -1	// global frag/point limit for all maps and gametypes
//g_ctf_capture_limit -1	// frag/capture limit for CTF
//capturelimit_override -1	// capture limit for CTF
//g_domination_point_limit -1	// frag/point limit for DOM
//g_runematch_point_limit -1	// frag/point limit for RUNE
//g_keyhunt_point_limit -1	// frag/point limit for KH
//g_lms_lives_override -1	// lives for LMS
//g_nexball_goallimit -1	// goals for NEXBALL

//g_ctf_win_mode 0	// CTF win mode: 0 = caps only, 1 = caps + points as tie breaker, 2 = points only
//g_ctf_ignore_frags 1	// set to 1 to ignore kills except for FC kills

// TEAMS for key hunt (change this to 2, 3, 4 to set a fixed keyhunt style)
//g_keyhunt_teams_override -1	// teams for KH

// GAME MODE: what type of server do you want to host?
// possible values: dm (deathmatch), tdm (team deathmatch), dom (domination), ctf (ctf), rune (runematch), lms (last man standing), arena (arena), kh (keyhunt), as (assault), ons (onslaught), race (race), nexball (nexball)

//g_maplist_votable_abstain 0	// when 1, people get a "don't care" selection in the vote screen
//g_maplist_votable_nodetail 1	// when 1, people can't see how many voted for what (to thwart abusive "influential" first votes)

//sv_vote_commands "restart fraglimit chmap gotomap nextmap endmatch reducematchtime extendmatchtime allready kick cointoss movetoteam_auto"	// players can vote for those commands or use them if they are masters. You canm also add 'g_grappling_hook' for hook voting, and 'sv_fbskin_green sv_fbskin_red sv_fbskin_orange sv_fbskin_off' for fbskin voting.
//sv_vote_master_commands "movetoteam_red movetoteam_blue movetoteam_yellow movetoteam_pink"	// add commands masters can use if logged in or elected. You may want to put 'kickban' here, so masters can keep out punks. It may be good to also put "sv_status_privacy 0" then...

//sv_vote_master_password ""	// when set, vlogin PWD will allow people to become master to run master commands directly using vdo
//sv_vote_majority_factor 0.5	// 0.666 will require a 2/3 majority instead of a regular 1/2 one
//sv_vote_simple_majority_factor 0	// 0.666 will win votes by a 2/3 majority of the VOTERS (not the players!)
// note: to JUST support simple majorities, set these two factors equal
