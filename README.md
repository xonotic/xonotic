## License

Xonotic is and will always be free and open source. It is available under the [copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/)-style [GPLv3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license (see the [COPYING](COPYING) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#licensing) files for full details).

## Download

Stable releases and related info are available at https://xonotic.org/download

[Beta builds](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Autobuilds) are available at https://beta.xonotic.org/autobuild

The source code included in stable releases and autobuilds can be [compiled as described on the wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Compiling).  This is much "lighter" than a full git clone.

*Please note, [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/) is our home for repositories, issue tracking, wikis, etc. The repositories on GitHub are mirrors of GitLab's unless specified otherwise.*

## Community

The community is primarily active in the [forums](https://forums.xonotic.org/) and [chat rooms](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Chat-Rooms).

## Contributing

We're looking for help in the following areas:

- [Translations](https://www.transifex.com/team-xonotic/xonotic/)
  - More info [on the wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/home#translating)
- [Modeling and texturing](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic-data.pk3dir/issues?label_name=Area%3A+Assets)
- Documentation
  - Some of it is still scattered in [Docs](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/tree/master/Docs) instead of being on our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home)
  - Some [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home) pages are slightly out of date or contain links to empty pages
  - Fixing typos everywhere and anywhere - attention to detail is important to make a good impression on potential players
  - Even if you're new, just letting us know what you're struggling with helps so we can focus on improving those areas first
- Testing
  - If you're running a server or play off-line often, please consider using the [autobuild](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/Autobuilds) or [git](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/Repository_Access) versions to help us find bugs (when playing online, the server's version of the gamecode is downloaded and used by all clients so you have to play offline or run your own server for testing)
- PR
  - Please don't create anything that looks official (social media accounts, entries on pages like steam, etc.) without contacting us, we like to manage things ourselves to keep the information up to date
  - All other kinds of PR are very welcome - make videos or articles, share links, spread the word
