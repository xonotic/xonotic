## Contributing

We're mainly looking for help in the following areas:

- [Translations](https://www.transifex.com/team-xonotic/xonotic/)
- [Modeling and texturing](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic-data.pk3dir/issues?label_name=Area%3A+Assets)
- Documentation
  - Some of it is still scattered in [Docs](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/tree/master/Docs) instead of being on our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home)
  - Some [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home) pages are slightly out of date or contain links to empty pages
  - Fixing typos everywhere and anywhere - attention to detail is important to make a good impression on potential players
  - Even if you're new, just letting us know what you're struggling with helps so we can focus on improving those areas first
- Testing
  - If you're running a server or play off-line often, please consider using the [autobuild](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/Autobuilds) or [git](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/Repository_Access) versions to help us find bugs (when playing online, the server's version of the gamecode is downloaded and used by all clients so you have to play offline or run your own server for testing)
- PR
  - Please don't create anything that looks official (social media accounts, entries on pages like steam, etc.) without contacting us, we like to manage things ourselves to keep the information up to date
  - All other kinds of PR are very welcome - make videos or articles, share links, spread the word
